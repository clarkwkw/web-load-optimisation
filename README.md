During my development on a local online education platform, I have tried out various tricks to speed up loading of front end. There is 1 question that sticks in my mind: is any of the tricks more effective than the others?

As the platform is already live, it is not possible to undo the changes one by one and compare. Hence setting up this dummy repo to experiment.

Findings are documented in this [wiki page](/wiki/Front-end-optimisation-tricks-retrospective).
